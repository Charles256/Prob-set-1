Answer each of the following questions by writing a Robot World program underneath the question. 
Refer to the powerpoint slide for specifics on where the robot is located, when required.

Note: You do not need to write a TurnLeft(); method. You should write any other methods you need, however.

1) Exercise 1.5 from powerpoint: Move the robot from its current position to positions A -> B -> C in that order.
Move();
Move();
TurnRight(); at A
TurnLeft();
Move();
Move();
Move(); at B
TurnRight();
Move();
TurnLeft();
Move(); at C


2) Write a method called MoveBackwards() to move the robot backwards 1 square from its heading. 
For example. if the robot is facing south at row=6 column=5, a call to MoveBackwards() should place 
the robot at row=7 column=5, still heading south. Call the method after you write it.
Define MoveBackwards() {

TurnRight();
TurnRight();
Move();
TurnRight();
TurnRight();
}

Move backwards();

3) Exercise 4.4 from powerpoint: Write a program so that if the Robot is in a row higher than 4, it moves down one square. 
Otherwise up one square.  NOTE: The Robot’s orientation is depicted in the diagram first (facing east).

Var row;
row = GetRow();
if(row>4) {
TurnRight();
Move();
TurnLeft();
}

else {
TurnLeft();
}
4) Write a method called MoveToRow(X) which moves the robot to row X where X can be any value 0-9. 
For example a call of MoveToRow(5); moves the robot from its current row to row 5. NOTE: the robot can start in any row.

Define MoveToRow(x)

row = getrow();
if(X>Row); {
while (x>row) }
TurnLeft();
Move();
TurnLeft();
Row = Row + 1;

{}

else {
while(x<row)
TurnRight();
Move();
TurnLeft();
Row = Row - 1
} {}
5) Exercise 9.2 from powerpoint: Write a program to sweep the entire grid, collecting all the markers on the grid (markers can be anywhere). 
NOTE: Think of breaking down the problem into a GetMarkersInRow() method first.

Move();
Move();
Pickmaker();
Move();
Pickmarker();
Move();
Move();
Move();
Pickmaker();
